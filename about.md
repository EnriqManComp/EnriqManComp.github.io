I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science driven by my passion for technology and programming, as well as my desire for professional growth. I am conducting research on Deep Reinforcement Learning for robotics applications as part of my thesis, exploring novel methods and algorithms to improve the performance and efficiency of autonomous agents. Also, I am engaged in projects and courses related to Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Software Development.

Before enrolling at CICESE, I worked as a telecommunications engineer at ETECSA for two years. In this role, I designed and administered network and IT solutions for various clients, improving their connectivity, security, and performance. Additionally, I collaborated with other engineers and programmers to develop and deploy software applications and databases.
